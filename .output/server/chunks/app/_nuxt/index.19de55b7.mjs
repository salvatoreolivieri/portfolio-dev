    title: "The identity illusion",
    text: `We believe that **people are born this way**, so we say: "it's his character", "it's his nature", "its a family traits".

    We believe we have an **identity** and **characteristics** that **define us as people**.
    
    We have built a **sense of self**: an identity that we believe is **unable to change** and we must **love it just as it is**.
    
    People don't change  be yourself  don't forget who you are.
    
    This sense of self took root in our idea of who i am and **gradually became our identity**.
    
    The problem is that, as human beings, **it's normal to want more than what we are**.
    
    We therefore dream of **growing** and **improving** ourselves and we create the **image of a desired self** and it is here that the gap between the two "I" (current version - desired version) begins.
    
    Every time we tend towards the desired self, a gap is created between **the person we perceive in this moment** and the one we could become. Chaos takes hold in our lives and **paralyzes us**.
    
    We are **unaware of the entire evolutionary process**, in our current situation we dream of a desired situation that fails to materialize.
    
    Have you ever stopped for a second and stopped asking yourself "who am i? ", where is this thing you call "me"?
    
    I tell you that:
    
    **The self is nothing more than a simple illusion attached to an identity built on the basis of past stories: you are nothing and at the same time you can be anything.**
    
    Everyone wants to grow and improve themselves, but this is impossible if you aren't willing to let go parts of yourself.
    
    At this precise moment there are two self: the **perceived self** (the person and identity that you feel yours right now) and the **potential self** (the person you can potentially become at any moment).
    
    Before understanding this concept, every day i acted in accordance with my "perceived self" (the identity that i felt was mine) and as a result i continued to become myself.
    
    **But then my life changed**.
    
    I **stopped restrict my ambitions** to the limits of my "perceived self" and i simply started feeding a potential self by deciding what i wanted to be.
    
    Now my sense of identity is **dynamic**, **fluid**, and **continually becoming**.
    
    I conceive myself as the **set of external inputs that interact and dance with my senses**.
    
    They are a set of **conditions** and **variables** that occur systematically as a **mental story** runs a script in my **operating system** and feeds a **sense of** **identity**.
    
    I can consciously **observe** how all this happens, i access the **source code** and **change the fate of my destiny**.
    
    By playing the parts of the **puppet** and the **puppeteer**, i influence the variables, dominate the game and **govern the fate of my future**.
    
    **I am a meaning-making animal in a meaningless world**.
    
    I live everyday open to let myself become **far from the noise**, out of a **moral sense of context**, far beyond the **conventions of right and wrong**.`

    subtitle: "The Universe DNA",
    title: "Paradox of complementarity",
    text: `Humans are **diversity** manifestation. **opposing parts that coexis**t within the same casing. **awareness** that wanders in an ecosystem where **order and chaos interact**. Within this game everything is complementary.

    Each of us is both **rational** and **irrational**, **introverted** and **extroverted**, **determined** and **careful**.
    
    We are used to think about the different halves that live within us as two distinct and separate wholes.
    
    ![Order and Chaos separated](/img/order-chaos-linked.jpg)
    
    When the truth is there are two subsets that are part of the same element.
    
    ![Order and Chaos linked](/img/order-chaos-separate.jpg)
    
    Your identity follow the same logic:
    
    ![Personality](/img/personality.jpg)

    You are probably more **introverted** than **extroverted**, **rational** rather than **emotional** and careful rather than instinctive but the potential of your other halves dwells within you, you just have to develop it.
    
    The ultimate goal that **moves** and **justifies** my every behavior is in the desire to **integrate every single part of me**, overcome **traumas**, **fears**, **wounds** and **develop inner completeness**.`

    subtitle: "Value and Experience",
    title: "The meaning of life",
    text: `If (identity === illusion && orderandchaoscoesistinsideofyou) {ask: so who the fuck am i? }

    Here's the answer: **I am the life meeting itself through experience**.
    
    Lets me explain that telling you a story.
    
    A university professor during a philosophy lesson on the meaning of things looks at his students and **says to them**:
    
    *"If i were a superior being capable of getting everything he wanted i think i would be bored, so you know what i would do? I would create a world governed by duality (light/shadow  harmony/chaos), i would divide myself into billions of parts, i would slip into it forgetting that i am a god and i would live inside this video game."*
    
    Some time ago, in conversation with myself, i asked myself what was the point of all this introspection, all this looking inside and getting lost in the labyrinths created by myself.
    
    Here **my personal reflection**:
    
    Growing, achieving more, looking inside and overcoming your limits is **not necessary to achieve happiness**, but it is what makes life damn interesting.
    
    I've always been looking for tools to live with more **enthusiasm** and **freedom** to be. To let go of any kind of **judgment**, **control**, **idea of separation**, **attachment**, **expectation**, **emotional influences** related to my wounds and live with **union**, **love**, **listening**, **connection** and **kindness**.
    
    All my research take me to the **enthusiasm**: the **spiritual evolution complementary** to nihilism.
    
    In a world devoid of **meaning**, traveling life with **peace** and **lightness** is a form of spiritual evolution.
    
    Every step of the journey is an incredible opportunity to **experience and meet part of the life and feel part of it**.
    
    The meaning of life is to take every step with **enthusiasm** and **joy**, **playing the videogame of life**.`

    subtitle: "The wonder of creation",
    title: "The happiness algorithm ",
    text: `So with all these things in mind why i want to put incomprehensible code inside an ide for 8+ hours a day for the rest of my life?

    To simple **experience the wonder of creating**.
    
    Think about it. I am life meeting itself through experience and contributing to the creation of life through the wonder of creating, **is there anything more beautiful than this?**
    
    I found happiness in **build things**, make things happen, understand how things works, **contribute to project** with a positive impact and **asking myself questions away from the noise**.
    
    I found joy in **love**, **authenticity** and **spontaneity of being**, all characteristics that i think everyone has within themselves and that they can cultivate and bring into their daily lives.
    
    I found **wonder** in the **simply being present and welcoming**, playing with life: a magnificent and perfect **experience**, navigating meanings through different questions and **points of view**.
    
    I found **gratitude in the everyday process**, living away from instant gratification and in the beauty of reality: the one who is authentic and never perfect.
    
    **This is my happiness algorithm and this is my life philosophy explained**.`
