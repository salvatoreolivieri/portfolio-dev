        This blog is the home of my introspective processes and the refuge of confused people, lost in oblivion and without a half.
        
        It was designed not to give any dogmatic answer, but to encourage the reader to ask questions.
        
        It was conceived to give life to a real digital museum: A place full of vintage, creative and counter-intuitive works of art.
        
        I wanted to create a space where art, philosophy and spiritual awareness could coexist and give visitors a sense of belonging.`,
