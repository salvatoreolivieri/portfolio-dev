Chaos takes hold in our lives and **paralyzes us**.\n    \n    We are **unaware of the entire evolutionary process**, in our current situation we dream of a desired situation that fails to materialize.\n    \n    Have you ever stopped for a second and stopped asking yourself \"who am i? \", where is this thing you call \"me\"?\n    \n    I tell you that:\n    \n    **The self is nothing more than a simple illusion attached to an identity built on the basis of past stories: you are nothing and at the same time you can be anything.**\n    \n    Everyone wants to grow and improve themselves, but this is impossible if you aren't willing to let go parts of yourself.\n    \n    At this precise moment there are two self: the **perceived self** (the person and identity that you feel yours right now) and the **potential self** (the person you can potentially become at any moment).\n    \n    Before understanding this concept, every day i acted in accordance with my \"perceived self\" (the identity that i felt was mine) and as a result i continued to become myself.\n    \n    **But then my life changed**.\n    \n    I **stopped restrict my ambitions** to the limits of my \"perceived self\" and i simply started feeding a potential self by deciding what i wanted to be.\n    \n    Now my sense of identity is **dynamic**, **fluid**, and **continually becoming**.\n    \n    I conceive myself as the **set of external inputs that interact and dance with my senses**.\n    \n    They are a set of **conditions** and **variables** that occur systematically as a **mental story** runs a script in my **operating system** and feeds a **sense of** **identity**.\n    \n    I can consciously **observe** how all this happens, i access the **source code** and **change the fate of my destiny**.\n    \n    By playing the parts of the **puppet** and the **puppeteer**, i influence the variables, dominate the game and **govern the fate of my future**.\n    \n    **I am a meaning-making animal in a meaningless world**.\n    \n    I live everyday open to let myself become **far from the noise**, out of a **moral sense of context**, far beyond the **conventions of right and wrong**.`,\n  },\n  {\n    subtitle: \"The Universe DNA\",\n    title: \"Paradox of complementarity\",\n    text: `Humans are **diversity** manifestation. **opposing parts that coexis**t within the same casing. **awareness** that wanders in an ecosystem where **order and chaos interact**.
