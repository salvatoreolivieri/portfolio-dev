We believe that people are born this way, so we say: “It's his character", “It's his nature", “It’s a family traits".

We believe we have an identity and characteristics that define us as people.

We have built a sense of self: An identity that we believe is unable to change and we must love it just as it is.

“People don't change” – “Be yourself” – “Don't forget who you are”.

This sense of self took root in our idea of “who I am” and gradually became our identity.

The problem is that, as human beings, it's normal to want more than what we are.

We therefore dream of growing and improving ourselves and we create the image of a desired self and it is here that the gap between the two "I" (current version - desired version) begins.

Every time we tend towards the desired self, a gap is created between the person we perceive in this moment and the one we could become. Chaos takes hold in our lives and paralyzes us.

We are unaware of the entire evolutionary process, in our current situation we dream of a desired situation that fails to materialize.

Have you ever stopped for a second and stopped asking yourself "who am I?", where is this thing you call "me"?

I tell you that:

The self is nothing more than a simple illusion attached to an identity built on the basis of past stories: You are nothing and at the same time you can be anything.

Everyone wants to grow and improve themselves, but this is impossible if you aren't willing to let go parts of yourself.

At this precise moment there are two “self”: the perceived self (the person and identity that you feel yours right now) and the potential self (the person you can potentially become at any moment).

Before understanding this concept, every day I acted in accordance with my "perceived self" (the identity that I felt was mine) and as a result I continued to become myself.

But then my life changed.

I stopped restrict my ambitions to the limits of my "perceived self" and I simply started feeding a potential self by deciding what I wanted to be.

Now my sense of identity is dynamic, fluid, and continually becoming.

I conceive myself as the set of external inputs that interact and dance with my senses.

They are a set of conditions and variables that occur systematically as a mental story runs a script in my operating system and feeds a sense of identity.

I can consciously observe how all this happens, I access the source code and change the fate of my destiny.

By playing the parts of the puppet and the puppeteer, I influence the variables, dominate the game and govern the fate of my future.

I am a meaning-making animal in a meaningless world.

I'm live everyday open to let myself become far from the noise, out of a moral sense of context, far beyond the conventions of right and wrong.
